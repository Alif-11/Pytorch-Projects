Already obtaining some fascinating results from the 3rd epoch trained CNN
on the CIFAR10 dataset.

Original, randomly sampled CIFAR10 image, after applying various transforms:
![Some sort of cat?](model_images/repeating_rainbow_cat.png)
Some kind of cat, rotated??

All channels of the CIFAR10 image, after the first convolutional block:
![Green cats](model_images/green_cat_cloned.png)
A bunch of green cats
